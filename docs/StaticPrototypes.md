# Static Prototypes

I typically create a static HTML/CSS prototype of what I want to build, and then I convert it into a hierarchy of React components.

## Volunteer Hours Grid

The following prototypes show the volunteer hours grid.

* [Minimum Styled Table, View Mode](https://maultasche.github.io/VolunteerHours/prototypes/minstyledtable.html) - The volunteer hours grid as a table in view mode
* [Minimum Styled Table, Edit Row](https://maultasche.github.io/VolunteerHours/prototypes/minstyledtable_edit.html) - The volunteer hours grid as a table when editing a row
* [Minimum Styled Table, Edit Row with Errors](https://maultasche.github.io/VolunteerHours/prototypes/minstyledtable_edit_error.html) - The volunteers grid as a table when editing a row and validation errors have occurred
* [Minimum Styled Table, Add Row]https://maultasche.github.io/VolunteerHours/prototypes/minstyledtable_add.html) - The volunteer hours grid when adding a row
